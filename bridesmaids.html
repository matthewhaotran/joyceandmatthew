                  grew closer and our friendship blossomed into the elaborate, enduring BFF bond we share today. From
                  our lengthy brunch/coffee/Tea Station dates, to our novel-length texts, to our silly selfies to one
                  another - my friendship with Nan is truly one-of-a-kind. Over the last decade, Nan has been by my side
                  through events, big, small, and everything in between, so it goes without saying.. I am blessed and
                  honored to have her as my matron of honor.

                <!-- <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">Favorite memory: One of my favorite (funny) memories with Nancy -
                  circa 2011 or so, we were in Vegas with the girls & a group of older creepers came up and started
                  talking to us. They asked for our names & everyone went down the line giving them fake names, once it
                  got to me I was too flustered and unprepared to give a fake name so I said my name was Nancy, as I
                  burst out laughing (busted my cover, oops!) then I see Nan next to me, giving me the stink eye after
                  hearing me give out her name. We still have a good laugh about it until today.

                  grown closer. I like to think of her as my closest, oldest friend. We were badminton doubles partners,
                  study buddies, and everything in between. Phung is one of the silliest, dorkiest, smartest, and most
                  thoughtful people I know. I think we get along so well because we are very similar but she is just
                  much weirder and outgoing than I am. I am so grateful to have her as one of my dearest friends for so
                  much of my life, and now my maid of honor.</p>

                  the most hard-working and strong-willed women I know. Britt is an excellent cook, DIY/craft queen, and
                  devoted mother. She is resilient and puts her heart into anything she does. She is always there for
                  Matthew and I, for anything big or small. We don’t know what we would do without her!</p>

                  throughout my life and I know that she always has my best interests in mind. She has been one of my
                  favorite role models and continues to astound and entertain me with her intellect and dorkiness. She

                  always lived within a few blocks of one another. I know I can always count on Vanessa to have my back
                  and give me her opinion when times are tough. I love her sarcasm and brutal honesty. I love telling
                  her funny/crazy stories because her facial expressions are everything and always crack me up. I am so
                  lucky to call her one of my close friends throughout the years and now one of my bridesmaids.

                  have had the privilege to watch her grow into the young woman she is today. I never imagined that
                  tiny, little bald baby would become this beautiful loser. She always teaches me who the kids are
                  listening to these days and what new slang phrases are popular, so I stay hip and cool. I am her
                  favorite cousin forever and she is my favorite when she’s not calling me boring or a grandma.
