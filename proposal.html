              <h3 class="h2 ww-title">Joyce</h3>

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">I always thought I would see Matthew’s proposal a mile away. For
                  previous surprises, I would be able to pick up on his nervous tics or random conversation (weirder
                  than normal) that would raise flags but this time around, I’ll say it.. he (unfortunately) got me
                  good. Lol</p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">Matthew concocted the plan of a fancy dinner party that we would
                  be attending in Paris. He described the dinner as an “interactive experience” wherein we would both
                  help cook the meals and then eat what we prepared. We had reservations for a similar pasta-making
                  class in Rome, so I figured it was the same idea. The evening of the dinner party we were to meet
                  the hostess at a bridge before we were led to the dinner. </p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">Walking up to the Debilly Footbridge, I noted on the beautiful
                  view of the Eiffel Tower and how we should rush to snap some pictures before our dinner. The bridge
                  was empty with the exception of a few bystanders and some peddlers selling locks and Eiffel Tower
                  replicas. We got to the railing of the bridge to attempt a selfie capturing the tower in the back. A
                  nearby professional photographer offered to take a picture for us and I thought “SCORE! A pro is
                  taking free pictures for us on our phone!” </p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">After handing us back our phone, Matthew shakily takes my hands
                  and turns to face me. He says “Get ready, this is happening.” Immediately my thoughts are racing,
                  “What?! What is going- Now?? WHAT!!??”</p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">“Wait,” I say, “noo, wait wait wait. What?” And before I could
                  gather my thoughts and muster a complete sentence Matthew gets down on one knee and presents me with
                  a glistening ring. I’m all smiles, “yes!” I exclaim, oh wait Matthew hadn’t asked me anything yet.
                  AH. I’m so flustered, a moment later he asks me the magical question to which I reply “of course,
                  yes.” </p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">The photographer came up to us and it turns out that Matthew
                  hired her to take pictures for us. We spent the next hour taking pictures and making googly eyes at
                  each other. We ended the night with a delicious meal at a nice restaurant next to the bridge where
                  he proposed. </p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">Bravo to the perfect proposal and night, fiancé!  I loved every moment of it : )</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
              <h3 class="h2 ww-title">Matthew</h3>
              <div class="mt-3"><img class="img-fluid" src="images/matthew.png" alt="Groom" data-aos="flip-left"
                  data-aos-duration="1000" style="max-height: 400px;" />

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">To start, the overall proposal was a complete success because it
                  was both beautiful and a complete surprise. Planning was both easy and hard. It was easy because Joyce
                  was quite oblivious to it all. She bought into the idea that’d probably propose in 2020. It was hard
                  because I love sharing everything with her and it was hard to keep my mouth shut leading up to the
                  proposal, especially during the trip because she is the only person I am talking to on a day to day
                  basis. Admittedly, I told more than a handful of other people that I’d propose to her in Paris.</p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">I got help from my mom, dad, Brittany, Ryan, Nancy, and Phung on
                  picking out the ring. Ultimately, we all agreed on the right ring for Joyce. I set up the
                  photographer weeks in advance through Google, went on some video calls with her to talk about us and
                  our story, and planned the perfect ruse to allow our photographer to capture the moment perfectly.
                </p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">We met on a bridge overlooking Tour Eiffel, where we walked and
                  stopped to take some pictures with the landmark. My photographer, looking like an amateur tourist
                  photographer, tapped me on the shoulder and asked if we wanted her to take a photo for us with our
                  phone. We obliged and after the quick photo with my phone, she handed the phone back and stepped
                  away. At that moment, I looked at Joyce and told her I wanted to ask something very important. Once
                  she realized what was going on, I dropped to one knee, made sure I didn’t drop the ring through the
                  cracks of the bridge and watched as her smile and eyes lit up.</p>

                <p class="pt-3 text-left text-muted">Our photographer captured the candid moment perfectly (we didn’t
                  need to take any posed proposal pictures!) and followed up with a full photoshoot and captured us
                  perfectly as we were both elated from the proposal. I definitely will never forget any second of
                  that moment.</p>
